# 🌱 FarmConnecta

**Building the digital infrastructure for Africa’s agricultural economy**

FarmConnecta is an Africa-first agri-tech platform designed to connect farmers, buyers, workers, service providers, logistics operators, investors, and agricultural finance institutions in one unified digital ecosystem.

Our mission is to reduce fragmentation in agriculture by enabling discovery, coordination, and trust — before automation and transactions.
